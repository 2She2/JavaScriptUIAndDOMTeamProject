JavaScript UI And DOM Team Project

We made a game called Mice, the main idea is to persuade the cheese, which spawns on a random place on the map and the tricky part is that there are cats which will try to catch you. If you are touched by a cat, the game is over!

In the project we have used Kinetic.js, Raphael.js and jQuery.js.

The background is made with Raphael.js, with an online coverter from a picture.
The mouse is made by sprites, as it changes it's view by turning from one side to another. We have also used animation for the change of positions of the mice

For every 10 pieces of cheese you get, you level up. When you level up, a new cat appears, so it gets really hard through the levels.
